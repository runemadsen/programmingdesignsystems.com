For a long time, the role of a graphic designer was rather easy to define. It meant working with your hands to find the right visual form for a piece of content, and delivery of a final, static design e.g. in the form of a poster, business card or letterhead. Amazingly clever and beautiful art has been created this way.

However, we find ourselves at an interesting time in the design world, not because this definition of design has changed much, but because the products we're required to build have changed. Looking at the media landscape of today, it's hard to find a design product that hasn't changed because of the digital revolution. Designing layouts for a smartphone app means taking into account a complex set of states, where each screen can have tens or hundreds of possible transitions. Designing the scenery of most computer games forces the designer to use procedural techniques, as it's simply impossible to design every detail by hand. Even logos are becoming dynamic, with designers building dynamic identities fit for representing many faces of the same entity. Common to all of these examples is that none of them can be built using traditional design tools, and all of them require the use of a programming language.

This book is the result of a simple question: What happens when we try to redefine the graphic design curriculum using a programming language as the tool for the designer? For some readers, this will be a provocative question. The field of graphic design is rooted in the fine arts, and students still go through curricula based on traditions taught by painting, sculpture, and architecture. This is of course a great positive, and this book builds upon that very foundation. However, when this tradition is used to wrongly turn designers into luddites (Paul Rand famously said *It’s important to use your hands. This is what distinguishes you from a cow or a computer operator* [^1]), designers are institutionalized to think of themselves as direct opposites to technical people: ideators, who come up with concepts for others to execute. This contradicts a century-long bond between design and advances in technology with the designer as a craftsman, and it  threatens to make the traditional designer irrelevant.

For others, this question will make perfect sense. The fine arts, and graphic design in particular, is a skill you learn through very specific rules. The history of graphic design is full of artists who thought of design as a system, even way before the computer. It's important for designers to learn how to code (or programmers to acquire design skills), simply because history shows us that systems can be expressive, creative, and challenge many of the notions inherited from traditional design labor. Furthermore, today these theories can be more than theoretical instructions for a manual workflow. We have the ability to write computer programs that create designs, and the designer of the future will need to understand how to deliver on that promise.

This is a book that teaches you how to make designs in code, and how to evaluate the success of algorithmic design products. The book is written for both programmers wanting to learn the fundamentals of design, as well as designers wanting to take advantage of algorithms in their design process. It is my hope that it will serve as an inspiration for new types of design projects, and help break down the barriers between two powerful sciences: Graphic design and computer science.

The text is written for readers with an introductory knowledge of programming in JavaScript, which means that little time will be devoted to explaining concepts like variables, functions, and loops. For this audience, I highly recommend Daniel Shiffman's book "XXXXXX"[^2], where Dan does a much better job at explaining these concepts than I could ever do. Although the examples are created using [P5.js](http://p5js.org), I have tried to write the text to be as general as possible, and all concepts should easily be portable to whatever graphics programming language you prefer.

As you go through the text, you will notice that it starts with the very basics. The code will be simple, and the exercises will be full of constraints. If this feels simplistic, keep reading. We will soon enough touch upon more challenging themes. My insistence on starting with the very basics comes from the philosophy that these simple relationships are also the most important ones, and they lay the foundation for some of the more complex ideas.

I'm not the first author to write about systems in graphic design, and this book builds upon ideas from many incredible authors, who are too numerous to mention. Even within the last ten years, lots have been written about the computer's impact on graphic design. A majority of this literature, however, consists of portfolio books showcasing the end products, without a discussion of how to evaluate whether these algorithmic design products are successful or not. At worst, this comes with a blind fascination of code-based designs, written by people who are not programmers. I often discourage my students to read books on generative design, which too often is another term for splattering a canvas with algorithmic drawing. That is not what this book is about. I am interested in introducing systems-thinking to the proven art of graphic design, not to replace the foundations of design with the unnecessarily complex.

I would like to thank a group of people, without whom this book would never have existed. When I moved to New York in 2009 to study at [The Interactive Telecommunications Program](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp) at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, I only had a vague notion of wanting to work in the intersection between art and code. As a Flash developer who primarily built banners for advertising, my two years at ITP introduced me to a world that completely changed my thinking. I would like to thank Dan'O Sullivan for his enormous support for this project, which started as a class at ITP, and later grew into its current form while I was financially supported by ITP as a visiting resident. This book would not exist without the help and mentorship of Daniel Shiffman, whose dedication to his students is only surpassed by his talents in writing. I want to thank Stewart Smith, who taught the *Visualizing Data* class where the very idea for this book began. My thanks go to all of the ITP faculty who helped shape these ideas, including Danny Rozin, Clay Shirky, Tom Igoe, David Nolen, Gabe Barcia-Colombo, and George Agudow. A special thanks go to Lauren McCarthy, the original author of P5.js, and to Casey Reas and Ben Fry ....
